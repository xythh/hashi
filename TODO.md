## Issues

having layout defined as a non existant layout fails to build files but does not display a error, fix this.

if fails parsing the front matter, continue and ignore the error(case where --- is just used for style bugs out)

command feedback is pretty poor and the default help is useless.

Better error handling, explicitily mention what happended.

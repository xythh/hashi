# Example 

  にほん{2} にほんご{0} にほんじん{4}

## ます{1}  Pitch marking works for headings too! 


pitch works as you would expect for all the different markdown elements.

1. いち{2}
2. に{1}
3. さん{1}

**あつ{1}** *ばか{1}*

おまえ{0}

==Hello==



## Masu{2}

##  ます{1} 

ナッツ{1}

きょう{2}

きょう{3}

Normal sentence with nothing

a{2} かんじょう{5} If the **number** is longer than the length of the word it will not add pitch to the word and will display as is.

{2} you can still display {} as long as it does not match to a word

You can even add pitch to English words! English{0} 바나나{3} or even korean!

Pitch on kanji?? WE can do that 漢字{0},though this is pretty bad style


はし{2}: it respects text after {} and maintains it.

あ{1}

しっけ{3} 

くゎら{1}, getting fancy are we?? (all 拗音 are grouped with there preceding grapheme with the exception of the youon versions of ゑ & ゐ as both dont have a unicode character)

あっ{1} かんじょう{3} かんじょう{2} 

かんじ{2}

きょうら{2} きょきょら{2} きょぎょしゃ{2}

The parser respects common punctuation and spaces between words かんじ{0},,かな{0}

⠀な{1}

よろしく{0} and よろしく{2}
